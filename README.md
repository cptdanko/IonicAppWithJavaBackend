# IonicAppWithJavaBackend: An app about the Galaxy's finest smugglers
The aim of this repo is to demonstrate how to build an Ionic(hybrid) app with a Java backend with a fun subject matter. The RESTful backend is essentially a Java web service and the Ionic app is an Ionic [sidemenu] app.

# Implementation details
The Java backend has been built using, 
* [Java 8] - although no Java 8 features have been used
* [Tomcat 7] - for deployment
* [Eclipse] - IDE
* [Jersey] - for creating the Java web service i.e. the RESTful backend


# Why the Star Wars reference?
The recent Star Wars movie was a big hit and while not everyone may like it, I thought it may provide a slightly different context to building a Java RESTful backend for an app and hence I decided to use it.  

# More details on this repo!
Here's a [blog post] that explains the Java backend part of the repo in greater detail. The blog post aims to make learning how to build a Java REST backend more interesting by telling a story of a developer(Danko) who is asked to build it when he has no experience with Jersey. The post provides details on the developer's approach on how to build a solution and a list of some of the useful tutorials he comes across on his journey to learn how to build a Java REST backend with Jersey.

# Ionic app 
The post titled "An app about the Galaxy's finest smugglers:Ionic app with a Java backend" continues the story of Danko and details the process of how he tried to solve the problem of building an Hybrid app and how did he go about it. The post discusses how Danko came across the Ionic framework and the various resources he found in his quest to know Ionic framework better i.e. the post mentions the various resources that Danko found on it.
