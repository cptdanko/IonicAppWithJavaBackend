# Java RESTful Backend - for the "Galaxy's finest smugglers" app
The aim of this repo is to demonstrate how to build a Java backend for an app with a fun subject matter. The RESTful backend is essentially a Java web service

# Implementation details
The Java backend has been built using, 
* [Java 8] - although no Java 8 features have been used
* [Tomcat 7] - for deployment
* [Eclipse] - IDE
* [Jersey] - for creating the Java web service i.e. the RESTful backend


# Why the Star Wars reference?
The recent Star Wars movie was a big hit and while not everyone may like it, I thought it may provide a slightly different context to building a Java RESTful backend for an app and hence I decided to use it.  

# More details on this repo!
Here's a [blog post] that explains this repo in greater detail. The blog post aims to make learning how to build a Java REST backend more interesting by telling a story of a developer who is asked to build it when he has no experience with Jersey. The post provides details on the developer's approach on how to build a solution and a list of some of the useful tutorials he comes across on his journey to learn how to build a Java REST backend with Jersey.
