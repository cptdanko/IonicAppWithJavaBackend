# Java RESTful Backend - for the "Galaxy's finest smugglers" app
The aim of this repo is to demonstrate how to build a Java backend for an app with a fun subject matter. The RESTful backend is essentially a Java web service

# Implementation details
The Java backend has been built using, 
* [Java 8] - although no Java 8 features have been used
* [Tomcat 7] - for deployment
* [Eclipse] - IDE
* [Jersey] - for creating the Java web service i.e. the RESTful backend


# Why the Star Wars reference?
The recent Star Wars movie was a big hit and while not everyone may like it, I thought it may provide a slightly different context to building a Java RESTful backend for an app and hence I decided to use it.  

# More details on this repo!
I am currently writing a blog post which provides details into how to work with this repo and provide some 
more insight into the thought process that went into building this i.e. a case study (of sorts) of how to approach building
an app that shows the galaxy's finest smugglers.
I hope to finish the blog post soon and it will be available on my [blog].
